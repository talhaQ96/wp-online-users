# WP Online Users
WP Online Users is a Custom WordPress Plugin that displays how many users are online on your WordPress site.

I am developing this plugin for one of my clients and a few more features will be added to the plugin soon, such as:

1. User role & location.
2. Displaying users via widget.

**USAGE**
1. Install and activate the plugin on your WordPress website.
2. Use shortcode [display-online-users].
